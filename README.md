一只懒狗！
Bug 开发工程师，职场摸鱼小能手，规律作息是：喝水、开发、上厕所。
渴望成为技术导向的低级业务仔，对前沿技术非常感兴趣。
欢迎大家找我勾搭。👏👏👏

A lazy dog! Bug development engineer, a good slacker in the workplace, my regular schedule is: drink water, develop, go to the toilet.
Aspiring to be a technology-oriented guy, but low-level business develop is the status quo, I am very interested in cutting-edge technology.
Welcome everyone to hook up with me. 👏👏👏(translation by Google translate, beacause my English is not good) 😜
